NAGP DevOps Assignment

This project contains 4 branches:
1. Task1
2. Task2
3. Task3
4. Task4

Each branch contains a README.md file which contains instructions to run those tasks. 

If we want to run the entire application in one shot, just combine the instructions of Task3 and Task4 and you should be good to go.
