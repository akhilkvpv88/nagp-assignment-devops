# nagp-assignment-devops
Task 3

How to Run
1. I have installed Jenkins on a separate EC2 instance and the same is accessible at http://13.233.215.17:8080/.

2. For security reasons, I am not sharing the credentials but you can ping me on Teams for the same. 

3. After successfully logging into above Jenkins server, once can trigger "nagp-devops-assignment" build. The same is also triggered whenever there is a new push to this repo.
